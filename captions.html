            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>A caption is a mini-story that answers all questions about a photo. <br> A caption requires time, thought, research, variety and consistency to write.</p><br>

            <h3>Captions also</h3>

                        <li>Every photo should have a caption for adequate identification of its contents and to insure its historical value.</li>
                        <li>Be certain that you write cutlines NOT cutelines.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Captions that talk to the photo or make insinuations and those that take liberties with the feelings of the person(s) in the photo are not only unjournalistic and in poor taste, they are also downright illegal.</li>
                            <li>Any staff that uses gag cutlines is opening itself up to problems ranging from black eyes to lawsuits.</li>
