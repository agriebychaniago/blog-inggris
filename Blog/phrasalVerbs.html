            <h1>Phrasal Verbs</h1>
            <p>Phrasal verbs are two or more words that together act as a completely new word, with a meaning separate from the original words. For example, pick up means to “grab” or “lift,” very different from the definitions of pick and up alone. Popular in spoken English, phrasal verbs can be quite confusing because their definitions aren’t always easy to guess—and there are thousands of them. In fact, many phrasal verbs are distinct variations on the same base verb, which can add to the confusion.</p>
            <p>For multilingual speakers, in particular, phrasal verbs are one of the most difficult topics in learning English. To help simplify this complicated issue, what follows is our guide to understanding English phrasal verbs, including a list of the most common ones.</p><br>

            <h3>What is a phrasal verb?</h3>
            <p>A phrasal verb combines a normal verb with an adverb or a preposition to create an entirely new verbal phrase—the phrasal verb. The meaning of a phrasal verb is usually unrelated to the meanings of the words that comprise it, so think of a phrasal verb as an entirely new and independent word.</p>
            <p>When used in a sentence, phrasal verbs act the same as other verbs for conjugation and placement, although they do have special grammatical rules about word order, which we talk about below. Phrasal verbs can be conjugated into every type of verb form, so you can use them anywhere you could use a normal verb.</p>
            <p>Let’s look at the phrasal verb get over as an example. The verb get alone means to “acquire,” and the preposition over alone usually refers to being higher or going above something. However, put them together and the phrasal verb get over means to “recover” or “overcome,” a completely new definition that’s separate from the definitions of get and over.</p>
            <p>You can use get over just like a normal verb, in any form or tense. Here are some quick examples:</p>
            <p><b>Simple Past Tense:</b></p>
            <p><i>I had the flu last week but got over it.</i></p>
            <p><b>Infinitive:</b></p>
            <p><i>He wrote a song to get over his grandmother’s death.</i></p>
            <p><b>Gerund:</b></p>
            <p><i>Getting over prejudice at work is never easy.</i></p>
            <p><b>Particle:</b></p>
            <p><i>Having finally gotten over the breakup, they were ready to return their partner’s things.</i></p><br>

            <h3>How to conjugate phrasal verbs</h3>
            <p>When a phrasal verb is used as the main verb of a sentence, you conjugate the verb part and leave the other words as they are. Simply use whatever form of the verb you would use if it were alone.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>I get up at noon during the summer.</p>
                <p>However, this morning I got up at sunrise.</p>
                <p>I have gotten up early too many times this month.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Notice how only the word get changes, but the word up remains the same. Also notice how get, an irregular verb, uses its irregular forms to fit whichever tense it needs.</p>
            <p>In this way, you can use phrasal verbs in all the verb tenses, so you’re able to communicate anything you want. Conjugation is also important for maintaining verb tense consistency if you’re using phrasal verbs in a list with other verbs.</p><br>

            <h3>Types of phrasal verbs</h3>
            <p>To better understand phrasal verbs, it helps to organize them into two pairs: transitive and intransitive; separable and inseparable. A phrasal verb can belong to only one of each pair (although all separable phrasal verbs are transitive).</p><br>

            <h4>Transitive phrasal verbs</h4>
            <p>Transitive phrasal verbs use a direct object, just like normal transitive verbs.</p>
            <p><i>Charlie couldn’t put up with the meowing cats any longer.</i></p><br>

            <h4>Intransitive phrasal verbs</h4>
            <p>Likewise, intransitive phrasal verbs do not use an object.</p>
            <p><i>The regional director was late, so the sales team went ahead without her.</i></p><br>

            <h4>Separable phrasal verbs</h4>
            <p>With transitive phrasal verbs, you can sometimes put the direct object in between the words, for example, “pick you up.” There are, however, a few rules to follow with separable phrasal verbs, so pay attention to our next section about word order.</p>
            <p><i>He forgot to shut the lights off before he left.</i></p><br>

            <h4>Inseparable phrasal verbs</h4>
            <p>Inseparable phrasal verbs cannot be split up and must be used together. </p>
            <p><i>The wayward son carried on without his father.</i></p>

            <h3>Word order with phrasal verbs</h3>
            <p>Most of the time, the words in a phrasal verb stay together. For intransitive and inseparable phrasal verbs, the verb and the particle must go next to each other and should never be split up.</p>
            <p>Separable phrasal verbs follow different rules, however. For starters, separable phrasal verbs are always transitive, so they always have a direct object. <b>You can put the direct object in the middle of separable phrasal verbs</b>, in between the verb and the particle:</p>
            <p><i>Augustus would never let Hazel down.</i></p>
            <p>This is also true for noun phrases; place all words in a noun phrase in between the verb and the particle of a phrasal verb:</p>
            <p><i>You would never let any of your friends down.</i></p>
            <p>Some separable verbs require you to put the direct object in the middle every time. For example, let’s look at the phrasal verb get down.</p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="salah">Incorrect &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>The beginning of the movie Up gets down everyone.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="benar">Corret &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>The beginning of the movie Up gets everyone down.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>On the other hand, sometimes it doesn’t matter whether the direct object comes in the middle or at the end of a phrasal verb. Both options are acceptable. Unfortunately, there’s no method for knowing whether or not you have to separate a phrasal verb; you just have to study and practice until it comes naturally.</p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="benar">Correct &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Pick the box up and carry it to the kitchen.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="benar">Corret &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Pick up the box and carry it to the kitchen.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>However, pronouns follow a special rule when it comes to separable phrasal verbs: <b>If the object is a pronoun, it must be placed in the middle of a phrasal verb</b>. Pronoun direct objects cannot go at the end.</p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="salah">Incorrect &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Pick up it and carry it to the kitchen.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="benar">Corret &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Pick it up and carry it to the kitchen.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Remember that not all transitive phrasal verbs are separable. Transitive phrasal verbs can be either separable or inseparable, so be careful of where you put your object. For example, the transitive phrasal verbs get through, come between, and go against are all inseparable, so the direct object comes after them every time.</p>
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="salah">Incorrect &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Nothing comes us between.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="benar">Corret &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</td>
                        <td>Nothing comes between us.</td>
                    </tr>
