            <p>Generic structure is structure of the text which consists of stages by which the text goes through. Generic structure usually consists of the beginning, middle, and ending stages (Martin, 1990).</p><br>

            <p>These are the generic structure of Narrative text :</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">How Do Bees Make Honey?</h3><br>

            <p>Bees are useful insects. There are about 20,500 kinds of bees, but only honey bees make honey. Honey bees live in groups called colonies. Each colony has one female queen bee, ten thousand of workers, and few hundred male bees or drones. Honey bees lives in hives. Inside their hive, the bees make honey comb of wax. The honey comb is a kind of bee apartment building full of six - sided rooms in which the bees raises young and store food. <br><br>
            The queen bee lays thousands of eggs. Worms look like larvae hatch from eggs. Each larva becomes a pupa, which looks partly like larva and partly like an adult bee. worker bees feed the young, clean guard the hive, and fly to and from flowers. They collect tiny grains of pollen and a sweet liquid called nectar for food. THe pollen is food for young bees. Worker bees use the nectar to make honey. Without bees bringing pollen from flower to flower, many plants cant make seeds.</p><br><br>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Giving Children Homework; Pros and Cons</h3>

            <h4>Issue: </h4>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; There are a lot of discussion as to whether children should be given homework or not. Is it enough for children having tie to study at school or needing additional time in home for study after school time?</p>

            <h4>Argument Contra: </h4>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Some people claim that children do enough work in school already. They also argue that children have their hobbies which they want to do after school, such as sport or music. A further point they make is that a lot of homeworks are pointless and doesnt help the chidren learn at all.</p>

            <h4>Argument Pro: </h4>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; However, there are also strong arguments against this point of view. Parents and teachers argue that it is important to find out whether children can work on their own without the support from the teaher. They say that the evening is a good time for children to sit down and think about what they have learned in school.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Furthermore they claim that the school day is too short to get anything done. It makes sense to send home tasks like independent reading or further writing task which dont need the teacher support.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion / Recommendation</h4>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I think, on balance, that some homework is good idea for make a smart children, but that should only given sometime when the children needed, dont everyday because children is human, the children can be boring with too much a homeworks.</p>
