            <h1>Obligation, Permission, Suggestion</h1>
            <p>Obligation is an act of making oneself responsible for doing something, in other hands Permission is an act of allowing someone to do something, or of allowing something to happen, Suggestion is an act or process of suggesting.</p><br>

            <h3>Obligation or Necessity</h3>
            <p>Likewise, the negative form expresses that an action is not necessary. Use the same modal verbs as with commands: must, have to, or need to.</p><br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>We have to wait for our boss to arrive before we open.</p>
                <p>You don’t need to come if you don’t want to.</p>
            </blockquote><br>

            <h3>Asking Permission</h3>
            <p>If you want to ask permission to do something, start your question with can, may, or could. Traditionally, in more formal and polite usage, may is better for permission; if you ask “can I go to the bathroom?” it could be misinterpreted as, “do I have the ability to go to the bathroom?” (However, in modern usage may and can are both perfectly acceptable options when describing possibility or permission.)</p><br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>May I leave early today?</p>
                <p>Could I play too?</p>
            </blockquote><br>

            <h3>Suggestion</h3>
            <p>What if you want to recommend something, but not command it? If you’re giving suggestions or advice without ordering someone around, you can use the modal verb should.</p><br>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>You should try the lasagna.</p>
                <p>That guy should wear less cologne.</p>
