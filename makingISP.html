            <h1>What is "Making Inferences"?</h1>
            <p>This is sometimes called <i><b>"reading between the lines".</b></i> When you make an inference, you use all of the information that you have available at a time to guess what is "behind" the literal information of a text... In other words, <b>you go beyond what is stated explicity in the text to infer the intended message</b> by  paying attention to certain <b>"clues".</b></p><br>

            <h3>Inference</h3>
            <p>A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning</p>

            <div class="tips col-sm-6 rounded">
              <p>For <b>example</b>, I <i>infer</i> that there is a ghost in my house based on the evidence that I have seen objects moving on their own.</p>
            </div><br>

            <p>Making an inference can be thought of as <b>"reading between the lines" of what you read or observe.</b></p>

            <div class="tips col-sm-6 rounded">
              <p>Clues in the book + My own thinking = Inference!</p>
            </div><br>

            <p>Summarizing is a powerful reading strategy. It increases comprehension and retention of information.</p>
            <p>When you summarize, you restate the most important information of a text, using your own words.</p><br>

            <h3>Summarizing is:</h3>
            <table>
              <tbody>
                <ul>
                  <li>Keeping</li>
                  <li>Deleting</li>
                  <li>Paraphrasing</li>
                </ul>
              </tbody>
            </table><br>

            <h3><u>Keeping</u></h3>
            <p>Keep only the <i>important</i> information and main ideas.</p><br>

            <h3><u>Deleting</u></h3>
            <p><i>Do not</i> include supporting details in your summary.</p><br>

            <h3><u>Paraphrasing</u></h3>
            <p>Use your own words!!!</p><br>

            <h3>For Example</h3>

            <div class="tips col-sm-6 rounded">
              <p><b>Original Passage:</b><br> Ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris, a good and wise king, was the first pharaoh. He spread knowledge to other parts of the world, while his wife, Isis, ruled Egypt in his place.</p>
            </div><br>

            <div class="tips col-sm-6 rounded">
              <p><b>Paraphrased Passage:</b><br> King Osiris was the first pharaoh and spread knowledge. Queen Isis ruled Egypt when he was gone.</p>
            </div><br>

              <p><b>Highlighted Passage:</b><br> <b>Ancient Egyptians</b> believed that <b>Osiris</b>, a good and wise <b>king</b>, was the <b>first pharaoh.</b> He <b>spread knowledge</b> to other parts of the world, while his <b>wife, Isis, ruled Egypt in his place.</b></p>
