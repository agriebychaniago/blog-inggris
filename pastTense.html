                <h1>Simple Past Tense—How It’s Used, With Examples</h1><br>
                <p>The <b>simple past</b> is a verb tense that is used to talk about things that happened or existed before now. Imagine someone asks what your brother Wolfgang did while he was in town last weekend.</p><br>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wolfgang <b>entered</b> a hula hoop contest.</p><br>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He <b>won</b> the silver medal.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The simple past tense shows that you are talking about something that has already happened. Unlike the <u>past continuous tense</u>, which is used to talk about past events that happened over a period of time, the simple past tense emphasizes that the action is finished.</p>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wolfgang <b>admired</b> the way the light glinted off his silver medal.</p><br>

                <p>You can also use the simple past to talk about a past state of being, such as the way someone felt about something. This is often expressed with the simple past tense of the verb <b>to be</b> and an <u>adjective</u>, <u>noun</u>, or <u>prepositional phrase</u>.</p>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wolfgang <b>was</b> proud of his hula hoop victory.</p><br>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The contest <b>was</b> the highlight of his week.</p><br>

                <h3>How to formulate the simple past</h3>

                <p>For regular <u>verbs</u>, add <b>-ed</b> to the root form of the verb (or just <b>-d</b> if the root form already ends in an e):</p>

                <p>Play <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Played</p>
                <p>Type <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Typed</p>
                <p>Listen <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Listened</p>
                <p>Love <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Loved</p>

                <p>For irregular verbs, things get more complicated. The simple past tense of some irregular verbs looks exactly like the root form:</p>

                <p>Put <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Put</p>
                <p>Cut <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Cut</p>
                <p>Set <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Set</p>
                <p>Cost <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Cost</p>

                <p>For other irregular verbs, including the verb <b>to be</b>, the simple past forms are more erratic:</p>

                <p>See <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Saw</p>
                <p>Build <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Built</p>
                <p>Go <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Went</p>
                <p>Do <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Did</p>

                <p>The good news is that verbs in the simple past tense (except for the verb <b>to be</b>) don’t need to agree in number with their subjects.</p>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wolfgang <b>polished</b> his medal. The other winners <b>polished</b> their medals too.</p><br>

                <h3>How to make the simple past negative</h3>

                <p>Fortunately, there is a formula for making simple past verbs negative, and it’s the same for both regular and irregular verbs (except for the verb <b>to be</b>). The formula is <b>did not + [root form of verb].</b> You can also use the <u>contraction</u> <b>didn’t</b> instead of <b>did not</b>.</p>

                <p>Example: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Wolfgang <b>did not brag</b> too much about his hula hoop skills.
                    Wolfgang’s girlfriend <b>didn’t see</b> the contest.</p><br>

                <p>For the verb <b>to be</b>, you don’t need the auxiliary did. When the subject of the sentence is singular, use <b>was not</b> or <b>wasn’t</b>. When the subject is plural, use <b>were not</b> or <b>weren’t</b>.</p>

                <p>Example:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The third-place winner <b>was not</b> as happy as Wolfgang. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The fourth-place winner <b>wasn’t</b> happy at all. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The onlookers <b>were not</b> ready to leave after the contest ended. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The contestants <b>weren’t</b> ready to leave either.</p><br>

                <h3>How to ask a question</h3>

                <p>The formula for asking a question in the simple past tense is <b>did + [subject] + [root form of verb]</b>.</p>

                <p>Example:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <b>Did Wolfgang win</b> the gold medal or the silver medal? <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Where <b>did Wolfgang go</b> to celebrate? <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <b>Did the judges decide</b> fairly, in your opinion?</p><br>

                <p>When asking a question with the verb to be, you don’t need the auxiliary did. The formula is <b>was/were + [subject]</b>.</p>

                <p>Example:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <b>Was</b> Wolfgang in a good mood after the contest? <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <b>Were</b> people taking lots of pictures?</p><br>
